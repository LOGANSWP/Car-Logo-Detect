# Car Logo Detect
### This is my graduation project for my bachelor's degree.
I'm Logan, a student majoring in Software Engineering at Southeast University.

I decide to make an iOS app for car logo detection.

### TODO
1. I'm thinking of using two APIs (Get Manufacturer Details, Get Models for Make) from https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/ to extend the functions in Wiki module
2. Design your own car
3. Car AI assistant
4. Driving test learning
5. Second hand car price information (table information display, map, filtering)
